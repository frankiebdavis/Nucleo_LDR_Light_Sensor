# 🌒 STM32 LDR Light Sensor with LED Control

This project uses an **LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)** to measure ambient light with the STM32F303RE Nucleo board and automatically toggles an LED based on brightness. The ADC continuously samples the light level, UART prints readings to a terminal, and hysteresis logic prevents flickering at threshold values.

## ❓ Problem

How can an STM32 microcontroller automatically **control an LED based on room brightness**, while avoiding rapid flicker when the light level hovers near a threshold?

---

## 🔨 Method

- **Analog Input (PA0):** LDR + resistor form a voltage divider; ADC1 reads the light intensity.  
- **Digital Output (PA10):** Drives an LED through a current-limiting resistor.  
- **Threshold Logic with Hysteresis:**  
  - LED turns **ON** if `lux < 600`  
  - LED turns **OFF** if `lux > 1000`  
  - Between 600–1000, LED **holds previous state** (prevents flicker).  
- **UART2 Transmission:** Prints live light readings and LED state every 250 ms.  

Key code excerpt:  

HAL_ADC_Start(&hadc1);  
lux = HAL_ADC_GetValue(&hadc1);  
if (!led_on && lux < 600) { LED ON }  
else if (led_on && lux > 1000) { LED OFF }  
sprintf(msg, "Light: %hu | LED: %s\r\n", lux, led_on ? "ON" : "OFF");

## ✅ Result

Sample UART output as lighting conditions change:  

```c
Light: 512 | LED: ON
Light: 580 | LED: ON
Light: 1203 | LED: OFF
Light: 1187 | LED: OFF
```


- Covering the LDR simulates darkness → LED turns **ON**.  
- Bright light or flashlight → LED turns **OFF**.  
- Hysteresis ensures the LED doesn’t flicker around the threshold.
